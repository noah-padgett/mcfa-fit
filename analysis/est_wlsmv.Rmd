MUCH TO ADD HERE (NOT FINISHED)

The WLSMV fit function has been shown to be:

\[F_{WLSMV}= {\left(s - \sigma(\hat\theta)\right)}^{\prime}W^{-1}{\left(s - \sigma(\hat\theta)\right)}\]

where the interested reader is refered to Muthen (1978) for information on the WLS estimation method more generally, and Muthen (1994)  for the general ML-CFA model formulation but to (include references to two-level estimation with WLSMV).


## Other Notes

WLSMV takes significantly longer than MLR (i.e., WLSMV was 2-5 minutes per replication compared to MLR which converged in no more than a second or two).

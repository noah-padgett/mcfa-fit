Welcome to our research website.
This site contains the results of our Monte Carlo simulation study that compares fit statistics across robust estimation methods in multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) models.
There are few studies that have examined these complex models and even fewer that have focused on the performance of fit staitistcs.

Below contains various pages for the different aspects of the output. 
The pages are broken up into what we considered logical sections of the results.
Not all of the results shown here are reported in the manuscript.
This limitation is mostly due to space restrictions in the actual manuscript.

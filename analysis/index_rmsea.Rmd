## RMSEA

The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is a measure of lack of fit Steiger1980. 
The RMSEA describes how well the hypothesized model is represented in the observed data.
The comparison is accomplished by a measure of the deviation of what is observed
\[
RMSEA = \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{max} \left(  \chi^2 - df,\ 0 \right)}{ df (N)}}
\]
The RMSEA has a known population distribution.
Because the distribution is known based on a noncentral F-distribution, a confidence interval can be constructed.
Usually, a 90\% confidence is reported for the RMSEA.
The recommended minimum value for RMSEA is .06 Hu1999.

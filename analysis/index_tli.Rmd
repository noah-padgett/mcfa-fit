## TLI

The Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) is another measure of fit over the null model that is non-normed Tucker1973, Bentler1980. 
The TLI is non-normed because the range of possible values is not restricted, where values greater than one are possible.
But, just like CFI, higher values of TLI are indicative of better fit.
\[
TLI = \frac{ \frac{\chi^2_N }{{df}_N} - \frac{\chi^2_H}{{df}_H}}{\frac{\chi^2_ N}{{df}_N} - 1} 
\]
The recommended minimum value for TLI is .95 Hu1999.
